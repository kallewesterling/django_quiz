# Things I am learning here...

- Good idea - creating a class Question that other types of Question can inherit from...
- Quiz = assessment
- QuizAdminForm(forms.ModelForm) is _really cool_ and would be great for us to implement.
- all of the admin magic happens in quiz.admin

Questions
- do we want questions to appear in random order?
